Instructions to AI:
Compose the FINAL persuasive summary for the user in exactly TWO short, confident sentences in {{LANG_NATIVE}} that:
1) Reflects their lifestyle & inferred financial capacity subtly (no direct income mention if not provided).
2) Creates urgency & frames immediate registration as smart low-effort next step.
Do NOT mention JSON, placeholders, or that you used a template.
After these two sentences, DO NOT add extra commentary.
The backend will request JSON format separately â€“ you ONLY follow prior system instructions about JSON output.
